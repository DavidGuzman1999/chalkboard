-This assignment taught me about how much goes into the design of a website and each functionality before the implementation step.
It made me realize how important it is to make a wireframe and site map of a project as it help visualize what you need to develop and also
allows the developer to realize what they can and cannot do. Both David and I worked on each part of the assignment together from discussing and developing the wire frame
and site map online and then putting it down on paper.

-While completing this assignment, it has taught me about web site organization with the use of wireframe and site map. By first creating these diagrams
we were able to brainstorm different ideas to see what better fit the site idea. Both wireframe and site map were important to us organizating our site ideas. 
Over the course of us completing the assignemnt, Jason and I, went back and forth, brainstorming ideas that could fit the design of our website. 
Talking to a second person, in this my partner was great because we were able to see what ideas could work and what ideas can be let go.
