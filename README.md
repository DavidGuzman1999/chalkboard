-This assignment taught me about how much goes into the design of a website and each functionality before the implementation step.
It made me realize how important it is to make a wireframe and site map of a project as it help visualize what you need to develop and also
allows the developer to realize what they can and cannot do. Both David and I worked on each part of the assignment together from discussing and developing the wire frame
and site map online and then putting it down on paper.
